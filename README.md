# Rabbithook

Welcome to the **Rabbithook** Monorepo! This repository contains the source code for the Rabbithook project, a comprehensive toolset designed for simplifying the use of React hooks. Rabbithook is inspired by Shadcn, but tailored for managing and adding hooks to your React projects with ease.

This monorepo is organized into three primary components:
- **CLI**: The command-line interface for interacting with the Rabbithook ecosystem.
- **Registry**: The backend service responsible for storing and serving the hooks.
- **Landing Page**: The public-facing website that provides information about Rabbithook.
